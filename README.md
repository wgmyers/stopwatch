# Stopwatch

Yes. It's a stopwatch.

## Why?

I was scratching an itch. Long boring story.

## How boring?

It involves Rubiks cubes.

## Never mind.

No really. I got into Rubiks cubes last year, and was using a clunky old online stopwatch to time myself. I finally got annoyed enough with it to write my own. In pure Javascript. As you do.

## As you do.

No need to be like that.

## Can I have a go on it?

No.

## No need to be like that.

Oh go on then.

## Huh.

So you say.
